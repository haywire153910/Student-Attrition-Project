# Student-Attrition-Retention-Project

 Data Science project using different classification algorithms

## Business Problem

The goal of the project is to build a model to help a university predict which of its students are likely to attrite from the Univerisity. However, the dataset could be used to build a model to predict student retention by switching the target variable in the dataset.

## Methods

Exploratory Data Analysis

Data Visualisation: determine relationships between independent variables (linear and non-linear relationships)

Aggregating Majors into custom 'Departments' to narrow down the independent variables, easiuer to deal with the categorical variable and notice their effect.

## Quick glance at the results

Bagging Decisiontree Classififer:

Score: 82.35%

Random Forrest Classifier:

Score: 80.79%

AdaBoost Classifier:

Score: 82.25%

GradientBoost Classifier:

Score: 84.79%

## Lessons and Reccommendations

Hypertuning is essential to improving accuracy.

Second term performance appears to bear the most weight on a students' decision to leave or stay at the univerisity.
DIstance from home is the second most relevant factor in a student leaving the Univerity.
